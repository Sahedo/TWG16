# Re-verce project
Re-verse is gipothetical universe versa, wich space filled by infinite Solid Primary Materia (called as Solid, sometimes as Prime), which is electrical gas and single protons. In this world peoples live in some voids, filled by secondary materias. Many of them travel thru the Solid on giant drill mashines, called Solidcrafts. These machines, son, are charged from the electrical energy of the Solid during its drilling.

The Solid has infinite mass and infinite gravity, balanced over its entire volume, which looks like weightlessness. However, in voids there is a phenomenon of displacement of gravity. The balance of gravitational forces is deformed at the void boundary and the gravitational vector is directed to this boundary from both sides.

In the center of the void world gravity balanced again, and there is also the weightlessness. Often in this place of voids a fragment of primary matter hangs and processes of radiation of energy are started in it. Thanks to this, such voids are illuminated by their inner sun. It is in these voids biological life was born and developed.

However, in this universe, on the contrary, there is the so-called primary life. Small in size, luminous creatures, their behavior similar to rats. They easily tolerate staying in the primary solid and move through it from one void to the other.
